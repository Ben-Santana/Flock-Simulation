# Summary
   Very aesthetically pleasing simulation of the behavior of schools of fish, and flocks of birds 🐟🐠  🦆🦆
 
   Based on what Craig Reynolds refers to as boids in his paper about _Flocks, Herds, and Schools_.
 
 
   Following three simple rules,


       Seperation - Each member stears away from one another as to not collide 👀
       Alignment - Each member of the boid aligns himself in order to travel in the same direction as those arround him 🧭
       Cohesion - Each member tends towards the middle of the pack 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
                   
                   
   and few others I added such as having them avoid predators, the boids move in a way that makes you think that they have a mind of their own.
